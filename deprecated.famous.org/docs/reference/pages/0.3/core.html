      <h1 id="core">Core</h1>

<p>We’ve done the <a href="licensing.html">housekeeping</a>, covered <a href="download-and-installation.html">how to get set up</a>, and talked about <a href="why-famous.html">why you might want to use Famo.us</a>. Now, let’s dust off our hands and start exploring the exciting stuff: the Famo.us platform itself. We’ll start by covering the core components of Famo.us, and gradually build our knowledge from there.</p>

<p>Most of the logic in your Famo.us application will deal with manipulating a set of <strong>six basic building blocks</strong>, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <em>engine</em></li>
  <li>a <em>context</em></li>
  <li><em>render nodes</em></li>
  <li><em>surfaces</em></li>
  <li><em>modifiers</em></li>
  <li><em>transforms</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these building blocks plays a central role in creating what appears on the screen. Understanding how each works on a conceptual level, and how they interoperate, is essential to understanding Famo.us as a whole.</p>

<h2 id="the-engine">The engine</h2>

<p>Every Famo.us application has one <em>engine</em>. It’s a single object that <strong>orchestrates all the components of your application</strong>. It manages all <em>contexts</em>, runs the <em>render loop</em>, and dispatches events. If your Famo.us application were a film, you could think of it as the director. (You’re the producer; you ultimately call the shots!) <a href="the-engine-and-contexts.html">More about the engine »</a></p>

<h2 id="the-context">The context</h2>

<p><strong>The <em>context</em> is a container for all visual elements</strong> in a Famo.us application. Anything that needs to be displayed on the screen must be added to the context. Although there can be more than one context in a Famo.us app, it’s most common for there to be only one. In film terms, you could think of the context as the stage. <a href="the-engine-and-contexts.html#contexts">More about contexts »</a></p>

<h2 id="the-render-tree--render-nodes">The render tree &amp; render nodes</h2>

<p><strong>The <em>render tree</em> is a hierarchical object</strong> that describes how all visual elements in your Famo.us application will be displayed. It’s made up of many <em>render nodes</em> that keep track of the <em>size</em>, <em>position</em>, <em>opacity</em>, and <em>transform</em> of displayed elements. You could almost think of the render tree as a storyboard, describing what every visual element will look like during every frame of the scene. <a href="the-render-tree-and-render-nodes.html">More about the render tree »</a></p>

<h2 id="surfaces">Surfaces</h2>

<p><strong><em>Surfaces</em> are the atomic unit of displayed content</strong> in any Famo.us application. They are one of the two predominant types of <em>render nodes</em>. They are the only type of Famo.us element that actually connects directly to a visible HTML element; every Famo.us surface maps to a visible HTML element (such as a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) in the DOM. Surfaces are individually animatable, and can be scaled, rotated, or skewed in 3D space. Think of surfaces like the actors and the props in your film. <a href="surfaces.html">More about surfaces »</a></p>

<h2 id="modifiers">Modifiers</h2>

<p><strong><em>Modifiers</em> control how rendered elements are displayed.</strong> Think of them like individual stage directions. They tell displayed elements where to go and, to a degree, what to look like. Modifiers are one of the two predominant types of <em>render nodes</em>. Although modifiers themselves are not displayed, they can affect the properties of one or many displayed elements. <a href="modifiers.html">More about modifiers »</a></p>

<h2 id="transforms">Transforms</h2>

<p><strong><em>Transforms</em> control the position, scale, rotation, and distortion of rendered elements.</strong> Used in conjunction with modifiers, transforms can give visible elements the effect of motion through space, scaling up in size, or spinning. <a href="transforms.html">More about transforms »</a></p>
