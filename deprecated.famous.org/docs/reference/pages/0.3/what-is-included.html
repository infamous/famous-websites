      <h1 id="whats-included-in-famous">What’s Included in Famo.us</h1>

<p>The Famo.us platform comes packaged with <strong>a wide variety of modules and utility classes</strong> that provide all you need to build a high-performance interface. You don’t need to know about all of these modules to get started, but <strong>you may want to bookmark this page</strong> for reference later.</p>

<h2 id="core">Core</h2>

<p>The core modules of Famo.us include all of the low-level componentry required to make Famo.us applications possible. <em>(Note that many of the objects listed here are only for the Famo.us engine’s internal use.)</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Context:</strong> The top-level container for a Famo.us-renderable piece of the document.</li>
  <li><strong>ElementAllocator:</strong> Internal helper object that handles the process of creating and allocating document elements for use in Surfaces (for internal engine only).</li>
  <li><strong>Engine:</strong> The singleton object initiated upon process startup which manages all active Contexts, runs the render dispatch loop, and acts as a listener and dispatcher for events.</li>
  <li><strong>Entity:</strong> A singleton that maintains a global registry of rendered surfaces (for internal engine only).</li>
  <li><strong>EventEmitter:</strong> EventEmitter represents a channel for events.</li>
  <li><strong>EventHandler:</strong> EventHandler forwards received events to a set of provided callback functions. It allows events to be captured, processed, and optionally piped through to other event handlers.</li>
  <li><strong>Group:</strong> An internal Context designed to contain surfaces and set properties to be applied to all of them at once (for internal engine only).</li>
  <li><strong>Modifier:</strong> A collection of visual changes to be applied to another renderable component.</li>
  <li><strong>OptionsManager:</strong> A collection of methods for setting options which can be extended onto other classes.</li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Accumulator:</strong> Accumulates differentials of event sources that emit a <code>delta</code> attribute.</li>
  <li><strong>DesktopEmulationMode:</strong> Emulate desktop input on mobile devices</li>
