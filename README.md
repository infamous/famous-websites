This is a backup of [famo.us](http://famo.us/docs) and
[famous.org](http://famous.org/docs) made with [httrack](http://httrack.com).
Mainly the purpose of this is to preserve the old documentation.

To view the old sites, just clone this repo, then open the `index.html` file in
your browser.

If you serve the files with a tool like http-server, then it will automatically
open index.html files without having to include "index.html" in the address bar
URLs.
